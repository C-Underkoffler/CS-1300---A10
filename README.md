# CS 1300 - Assignment 10

### General
This program was an Assignment for CS 1300 at CU Boulder (Instructor: Dr. Knox, TA: Erik Holbrook). Provided to use were a list of books (books.txt) and a list of student ratings (ratings.txt) of those books. The students rated the books from -5 to 5 with 0 meaning they have not read the book. The ratings are in the same order as the books appear in the books.txt file. The program just takes the rating information into a class, and then is able to find the average rating of a book, students with similar ratings, and recommend a new book based off of a similar student's response.

#### Running the Program
Per the assignment instructions the only outputs were for my own troubleshooting. I left all of my print statements in, so comment them out if you'd like to see what is going on at a certain step.
